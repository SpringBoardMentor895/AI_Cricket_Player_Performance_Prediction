# IPL Data Analysis – Week 1 & 2

This repository contains my work and understanding from **Week 1 and Week 2** of the Infosys Springboard program, focused on **Data Acquisition and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using IPL datasets.

## Contents
- `data_cleaning.ipynb`  
  Basic data cleaning steps such as handling missing values, normalizing column names, and fixing date formats.

- `eda.ipynb`  
  Initial exploratory analysis to understand data structure, distributions, and basic patterns.

- `feature_engineering.ipynb`  
  Simple feature creation from the IPL data for further analysis.

## Dataset
IPL ball-by-ball and match-related datasets were used for learning purposes.  
(The dataset files are not included in this repository.)

## Objective
To understand how to inspect, clean, and explore real-world data before applying machine learning models.
